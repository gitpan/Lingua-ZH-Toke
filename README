This is the README file for Lingua::ZH::Toke, a Chinese Tokenizer on
steroids; it's a thin wrapper around Lingua::ZH::TaBE, as well as its
interface with overload and utf8 semantics.

* Installation

This modules requires Lingua::ZH::TaBE, which in turn needs libtabe
version 0.2.5 or above installed; please install the former from CPAN,
and the latter from ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/libtabe/devel/
before running Makefile.PL.

Lingua::ZH::Toke uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
